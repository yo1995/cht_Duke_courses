For this problem, you will implement a Map with a Binary Search Tree.
You should write a templated BstMap class in a file called bstmap.h.
Your BstMap should implement the ADT found in map.h, and must use
a BST.  Note that your lookup function should throw a std::invalid_argument
exception if the key is not found.  If you add a key which already exists,
you should replace its value.

You should test this code yourself in a separate file.
