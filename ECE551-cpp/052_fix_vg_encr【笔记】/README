In a previous problem, you executed a Ceaser Cipher encryption program by hand.
That program read an input file, and wrote to standard output.  

In this problem, you are going to work on a slightly modified version of that program,
which is is included in encrypt.c.   The major difference between this version
of the program and the previous one is that rather than printing to stdout, 
this program appends ".enc" to the input file name, and writes its output to that
file (for example, if your input file is called "input.txt", it will write to "input.txt.enc").
Additionally, rather than using fgetc to read one character at a time, this version
of the program uses getline to read an entire line at a time.

This program has the basic algorithm correct, but makes a variety of errors---all of which
valgrind will detect.  Your job for this problem is to fix the program by making it 
valgrind cleanly. 

Hint: Start from the first valgrind error.  Read and understand the error.  It will
      tell you on what line of code valgrind detected the problem.  Understand the
      error, and why it is occuring (drawing some pictures will likely help here).
      Fix the error, make, and re-run.  Repeat the process until all valgrind errors are
      gone.   Don't forget that gdb may be useful as well.
