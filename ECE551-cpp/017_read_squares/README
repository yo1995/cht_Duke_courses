After you and your partner have convinced yourselves that both of you
have written correct code, execute your partner's code by hand, 
with the following main function:

int main(void) {
 squares(4, 2, 1, 4);
 return 0;
}

Write your output in a file called "answer.txt".   When you are done,
submit that file.
