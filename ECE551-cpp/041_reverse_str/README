For this problem, you will write the function

  void reverse(char * str) 

in the provided reverse.c file.  This function should reverse the string
passed into it (that is, if given "abc", it should change the contents
of that string to read "cba"). Note that this function's return type
is "void"---it modifies the string passed into it in place.

We have provided a main function which you can use to test your
reverse function (do you recognize the quotations?).  The correct
output for your program can be found in reverse_ans.txt, so you can
diff your program's output against it.

Submit your reverse.c file for grading.
