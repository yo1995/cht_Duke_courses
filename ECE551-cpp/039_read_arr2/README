 1. Execute the code in "test.c" by hand, and write the output
    into a file called "answer.txt"

    Hint: you may need to consult the man pages for functions
    that you are not familiar with.

 2. Create a Makefile to compile test.c into a program called "test"
     
 3. Run test and use its output to check your work.

 4. Submit your Makefile and answer.txt
