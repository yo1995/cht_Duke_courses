For this problem, you will be writing the function which computes the output file name.
That is, given an input file name (such as "input.txt"), it should allocate memory
for and fill in a string with the output file name ("input.txt.counts").  

You should write the function

 char * computeOutputFileName(const char * inputName)

in the outname.c file.  You can make and test with the main function found
in outname_test.c.  As always, be sure your program valgrinds cleanly.
