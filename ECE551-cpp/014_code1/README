Open the code1.c file you have in this directory.
You will see two functions:  max and main.

In max, the algorithm is written as comments, but there is no code.
You should translate this algorithm to code.

In main, there are three print statements which call max and print
its result.  These would let you check if max is working right.

There is also a comment asking you to write one more print statement
with a call to max.  In that comment, it asks you to take the max
of two numbers (written as hex), and print them out.
Add a line of code to do this.

When you have done this, run

./test.sh

This script will try to compile your code (which you will learn about in
the next chapter), as well as run it.   If your code does not have legal
syntax, it will do its best to describe what is wrong.  If there
is a problem, look at the code and try to see where you did not follow
the syntax rules from chapter 2.  The line number and message it gives
may help you find the problem.  If you cannot find the problem after a minute
or two, ask for help.

If your code has legal syntax, test.sh will also run it, and show
you the output it produced, as well as the output we expected.

If they are the same, you should commit, push, and grade.

If they are not, you should see if you can fix the problem (and ask for help
if you cannot).
