This is your third *evaluative* assignment.
As before, that means that we want you to show
us what you know/what you can do (as opposed to 
most assignments, which are to practice and learn from).

Accordingly, you may not work with anyone else on this
assignment.  All work must be your own. 

To proceed, run

honor-statement 060_stat

which will present you with the rules for this assignment,
ask you questions to make sure you understand,
and ask you to sign the honor statement.

Once you have done that, your directory will be
refreshed with the actual assignment.
