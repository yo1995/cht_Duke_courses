A collection for Duke courses related code.

## ECE551 Data Structure and Algorithms
Learnt someting about coding. Never copy code from other sources. Childish toy projects might not be severe, but industrial ones really hurts!

## ECE581 Random Signals and Processes
Some ROC curves plotting with matlab. Also an important note from Oppenheim's, about MMSE.

## ECE587 Information Theory
Really helpful and thought-provoking by Prof. Galen Reeves.
A simple project of algorithm composing with Python. The project will be put in another repository.

## ECE590 ALG
some homework solutions with nicely implemented algorithms for those who cannot understand describing algorithms in 'simple English'

## ECE590 NLP
Project posters and reports.

## ECE564 iOS
Just a link to the real repo...

## ECE 563 Cloud Computing
Slides and final report

## ECE590 Image Processing
Selected reports

## ECE 650
Due to security issues, homework answers will be added later.

...to be continued.
