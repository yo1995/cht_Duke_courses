Suppose that the int type is 32 bits, and you have:

int x = 5;
double d = 2.4;
char c = 'a';

Determine the type and value of each of the following expressions,
and write them in answers.txt.  The first is done for you

1. x - 2
2. x + d
3. x / 2
4. d + x / 3
5. c + x
6. x + 0xFFFFFFFF
7. x + 0x7FFFFFFF
8. d + c
