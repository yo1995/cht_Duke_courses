For this problem, you will write a "Point" class in point.h and point.cpp.
The Point class will represent a 2-D point (i.e., it has an x and a y).
The class should have fields for the x and y, which should be private doubles.

The Point class must have the following public functionality:

 - A default constructor, which initializes the point's x and y to 0.
 - The method
     void move(double dx, double dy);
   which increases the point's x by dx, an its y by dy.
 - The method
     double distanceFrom(const Point & p);
   which takes a constant reference to another point, and computes the distance
   between the two points.  If you do not remember the formula for the distance
   between two points, you should be able to find this domain knowledge easily
   on the Internet.


We have provided a main function (in main.cpp) which makes use of your Point class.
Specifically, it reads input from stdin, where the first line tells it how many
Points to create.  It then reads one command per line until end of input, where
a command is either 

m pnum dx dy

or

d p1 p2

The first moves the point specified by pnum (which is an int) by <dx,dy> (which
are floats).   The second prints the distance between the points specified by p1
and p2 (which are ints).

We have already provided a sample input (input1.txt) and sample output (output1.txt)
