For this problem, you will be revisit the IntMatrix class you did in a previous 
assignment, but will make a templated matrix.  You have been provided with Matrix.h,
test.cpp, and a Makefile. As you are writing templated classes and functions, you should 
write them in Matrix.h.

 - You should write a templated class Matrix, which works like your IntMatrix, except for
   any type T, not just ints.  You should use vector<T> for each "row" (instead of IntArray).

 - Your new Matrix class should provide similar methods, constructors, operators, and destructor
   to your IntMatrix class, though you may need to change some types.

 - You should be able to compile and run with the provided test.cpp file without modifying it.

This problem is primarily an excercise in working with templates, not designing new/complex
algorithms.  You may find it easy to start with your IntMatrix code and make the 
required changes (which should be minimal).

As always, compile, test, debug, and valgrind your program.
