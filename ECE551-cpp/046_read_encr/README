Execute the code from encrypt.c by hand, assuming the program is run as

  ./encrypt 5 input.txt

Write your answer in answer.txt.

As always, you should compile (we have provided a Makefile) and run the program,
and diff the answer against your own to ensure you have the correct output.

When your answer is correct, submit answer.txt


As a side note, what this program does is perform a "Ceaser Cipher"---a very
simplistic form of encryption, which (as we will see in the next problem) is 
very easy to break.
