Examine the provided "broken.c" file, which has some errors in it.  
(Hint: you might execute it by hand)
Find, and list these errors in a file called "answer.txt".
The format of your answer file should be one line per error with
the line number, followed by a space, followed by one of the following
phrases describing the error:

  return dangling pointer
  use of dangling pointer
  index out of bounds
  use of uninitialized value
  
The errors should be listed in the order that you encounter them during
the execution of the program.  If you use an illegal value, after you note
the error, you may assume it evaluated to 0 to continue executing your code.

For example, your answer.txt might  look like this (although this is,
of course, not the correct answer):

2 return dangling pointer
4 use of dangling pointer
7 index out of bounds
9 use of uninitialized value
8 index out of bounds

Note that a correct answer will have 6 lines and use every type of
error listed above at least once.
