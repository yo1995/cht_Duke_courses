This problem is intended for you to practice the
basics of algorithmic development and execution
by hand that you learned in Chapter 1.

Here is what you need to do:

 (1) Find a partner.  
 (2) One of you should do problem 1.7 from AoP [page 20]
     The other should do problem 1.8 from AoP  [page 21]
 (3) Notice that step [3] of each problem asks
     you to give your algorithm to your partner.  When
     you both finish writing your algorithm and
     executing it for N=6, swap with your partner. 
     Execute your partner's algorithm and compare
     answers.
     Did you get the same answers?  Was
     something ambiguous in the algorithm?
     Did you find the patterns correctly?

 (4) After you finish, create a file in this
     directory called "done.txt" and write

Yes, we did this!

     in that file.  After you have done that, save the file,
add it to git, commit it, push it, and request it to be graded
(if you do not remember how, look back at 000_submit).
