Consider the following function which has 3 syntax errors in it

//begin code
                                 //line 1
int f(int x) {                   //line 2
  int answer = 0                 //line 3
  for (int i = 0; i < X; i++) {  //line 4
    answer += i * i;             //line 5
  }                              //line 6
  return answer;                 //line 7
                                 //line 8
//end code                       

Examine the code and find the 3 errors in it.
Once you have found the errors in this code, open the file
called "errors.txt", and write down the type of error
on the line where it occurs.  You should write one of the following

undeclared variable
missing {
missing }
missing (
missing )
missing ;
type name missing from variable declaration

For lines that are correct, leave the corresponding entry in the error.txt
file unchanged.

Once you have identified the errors, correct them in the file "code.c".

Submit both "errors.txt" and "code.c" for grading (add both to git, commit, push, and grade).
