**     REMINDER: starting now your  programs      **
**     MUST valgrind cleanly for full credit!     **
****************************************************

Execute the code in test.c by hand.  As you execute this code,
identify the lines on which memory leaks.  Write the line numbers
down in a file called "leaks.txt" (one line number per line),
then add calls to free to correct the code so it does not leak memory.

The only changes you may make to this code to fix it are to add
calls to free.  Check your work with valgrind.

 valgrind --tool=memcheck ./008
 
valgrind --leak-check=full ./test

内存泄漏的行数由调用泄漏后的变量的行数，或返回的行数定义
