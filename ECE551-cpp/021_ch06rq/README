As always, read and understand Chapter 6, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".

1. What is the goal of testing? C

A. To show that a program has no errors ("bugs") in it.
B. To fix problems that have been identified with a program.
C. To identify errors in a program. 
D. None of the above.

2. What is the goal of debugging? B

A. To show that a program has no errors ("bugs") in it.
B. To fix problems that have been identified with a program.
C. To identify errors in a program. 
D. None of the above.

3. How should you approach debugging? C

A. Guess and check.
B. Mutate and validate.
C. Apply the scientific method.
D. None of the above.


4. How does the number of paths through a control flow graph grow? D

A. Logarithmically with the number of conditionals.
B. Linearly with the number of conditionals.
C. Quadratically with the number of conditionals.
D. Exponentially with the number of conditionals.


5. How does a "debugger" (such as gdb) fit into the debugging process? C

A. It automatically identifies the most common problems.
B. It contains reference material on compiler errors. 
C. It helps you to gather information and test hypotheses.
D. It generates hypotheses for you from the information at hand.


6. What is a breakpoint? A

A. A debugger construct which causes execution to stop on a particular line
B. A debugger construct which causes execution to stop when a particular 
   location changes.
C. A debugger construct which causes execution to stop when the program
   would otherwise crash.
D. A debugger construct which causes execution to stop when a particular
   line of output is generated.

7. What is a watchpoint? B //监视点是为了监视变量发生变化所设置的，而非断点那种到了地方就暂停

A. A debugger construct which causes execution to stop on a particular line
B. A debugger construct which causes execution to stop when a particular 
   location changes.
C. A debugger construct which causes execution to stop when the program
   would otherwise crash.
D. A debugger construct which causes execution to stop when a particular
   line of output is generated.


8. What does an "assert" statement do? D

A. Checks that you have obtained statement coverage with your test cases.
B. Prints a message that its argument is true at that point in the program.
C. Informs the debugger of a logical property of the program.
D. Causes the program to crash if its argument is false.


9. What is required for a hypothesis to be testable? B

A. It must analyze a finite class of input conditions.
B. It must make specific predictions about the program's behavior
   on some category of inputs.
C. It must describe the behavior of error and non-error inputs.
D. It must be formed from careful analysis of all paths through the 
   control flow graph.

10. What does "fail fast" mean? B

A. It means that you run your test cases that identify errors first.
B. It means that your program crashes quickly after the erroneous code.
C. It means that you give up quickly on a task if it is beyond your skill level.
D. It means that your program exhibits any errors early in the development cycle.
